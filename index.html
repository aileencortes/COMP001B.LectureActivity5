    <h1>Volcano</h1>
    <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, 
        that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber 
        below the surface. </p>

    <p>On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging 
        or converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-ocean ridge, 
        such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic 
        plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent 
        tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching 
        and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and 
        the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America.
        Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from 
        upwelling diapirs from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi)
        deep in the Earth. This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian 
        hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic 
        plates slide past one another. Large eruptions can affect atmospheric 
        temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and 
        cool the Earth's troposphere. Historically, large volcanic eruptions have 
        been followed by volcanic winters which have caused catastrophic famines.</p>
        
    <p>Other planets besides Earth have volcanoes. For example, volcanoes are 
        very numerous on Venus.</p>

    <h1> Etymology</h1> 
    <p> The word volcano is derived from the name of Vulcano, a volcanic island 
        in the Aeolian Islands of Italy whose name in turn comes from Vulcan, 
        the god of fire in Roman mythology. The study of volcanoes is called 
        volcanology,sometimes spelled vulcanology.</p>

    <h1> Plate tectonics</h1>  
    <p>According to the theory of plate tectonics, Earth's lithosphere, its 
        rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger and several smaller 
        plates. These are in slow motion, due to convection in the underlying 
        ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes place along 
        plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere is being 
        destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created).</p>

     <p>During the development of geological theory, certain concepts that 
        allowed the grouping of volcanoes in time, place, structure and 
        composition have developed that ultimately have had to be explained in the 
        theory of plate tectonics. For example, some volcanoes are polygenetic with 
        more than one period of activity during their history; other volcanoes that 
        become extinct after erupting exactly once are monogenetic (meaning "one 
        life") and such volcanoes are often grouped together in a geographical 
        region.</p>  

    <h2>Divergent plate boundaries</h2>
    <p>At the mid-ocean ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as 
        hot mantle rock creeps upwards beneath the thinned oceanic crust. The decrease 
        of pressure in the rising mantle rock leads to adiabatic expansion and the 
        partial melting of the rock, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic 
        crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans, and 
        so most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. 
        Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of 
        volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea level, 
        volcanic islands are formed, such as Iceland.</p>
